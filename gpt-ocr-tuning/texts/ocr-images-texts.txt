Stop!  There was first a game of blindman\'s buff.  Of course there was.\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\nin his boots.  My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\nScrooge\'s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.  The\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage\non the credulity of human nature.
"Speak, thou vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though\nungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,\nmighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all divers,\nthou has dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has\nmoved amid the world\'s foundations.  Where unrecorded names and navies rust,\nand untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate\nearth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful\nwater-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or\ndiver never went; has slept by many a sailer\'s side, where sleepless mothers\nwould give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw\'st the locked lovers when\nleaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting\nwave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.  Thou saw\'st the\nmurdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell\ninto the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed\non unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would\nhave borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.  O head! thou has\nseen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one\nsyllable is thine!"\n\t\t-- H. Melville, "Moby Dick"

Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built, Portia was sleek,\nshapely, and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding her body, which was as warm\nas seatcovers in July, her hair as dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like\nbright hubcaps, and her lips as dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood;\nshe was a woman driven -- fueled by a single accelerant -- and she needed a\nman, a man who wouldn\'t shift from his views, a man to steer her along the\nright road: a man like Alf Romeo.\n\t\t-- Rachel Sheeley, winner\n\nThe hair ball blocking the drain of the shower reminded Laura she would never\nsee her little dog Pritzi again.\n\t\t-- Claudia Fields, runner-up\n\nIt could have been an organically based disturbance of the brain -- perhaps a\ntumor or a metabolic deficiency -- but after a thorough neurological exam it\nwas determined that Byron was simply a jerk.\n\t\t-- Jeff Jahnke, runner-up\n\nWinners in the 7th Annual Bulwer-Lytton Bad Writing Contest.

The Least Perceptive Literary Critic\n\tThe most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  A\nmost individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round to\ngive a public reading of his latest poem.\n\tPope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when Lord\nHalifax stopped him four or five times and said, "I beg your pardon, Mr.\nPope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me."\n\tPope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeable\nand unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  "Be so good as to mark\nthe place and consider at your leisure.  I\'m sure you can give it a better\nturn."\n\tAfter the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.\nGarth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  "There is no need to touch the\nlines," he said.  "All you need do is leave them just as they are, call on\nLord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observation\non those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known him\nmuch longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event."\n\tPope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poem\nexactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none of\ntheir edge.  "Ay", he commented, "now they are perfectly right.  Nothing can\nbe better."\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, "The Book of Heroic Failures"

Well, anyway, I was reading this James Bond book, and right away I realized\nthat like most books, it had too many words.  The plot was the same one that\nall James Bond books have: An evil person tries to blow up the world, but\nJames Bond kills him and his henchmen and makes love to several attractive\nwomen.  There, that\'s it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took\n*thousands* of words to say it.\n\tOr consider "The Brothers Karamazov", by the famous Russian alcoholic\nFyodor Dostoyevsky.  It\'s about these two brothers who kill their father.\nOr maybe only one of them kills the father.  It\'s impossible to tell because\nwhat they mostly do is talk for nearly a thousand pages.  If all Russians talk\nas much as the Karamazovs did, I don\'t see how they found time to become a\nmajor world power.\n\tI\'m told that Dostoyevsky wrote "The Brothers Karamazov" to raise\nthe question of whether there is a God.  So why didn\'t he just come right\nout and say: "Is there a God? It sure beats the heck out of me."\n\tOther famous works could easily have been summarized in a few words:\n\n* "Moby Dick" -- Don\'t mess around with large whales because they symbolize\n  nature and will kill you.\n* "A Tale of Two Cities" -- French people are crazy.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry
